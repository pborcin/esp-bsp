ESP32-S3-Korvo-1 is a development kit that is based on Espressif’s ESP32-S3 SoC and ESP-Skainet, Espressif’s speech recognition SDK. It features a three-microphone array which is suitable for far-field voice pick-up with low power consumption. The ESP32-S3-Korvo-1 board supports voice wake-up and offline speech command recognition in Chinese and English languages. With ESP-Skainet, you can develop a variety of speech recognition applications, such as smart displays, smart plugs, smart switches, etc.

The ESP32-S3-Korvo-1 board consists of two parts: the main board (ESP32-S3-Korvo-1) that integrates the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module, function buttons, SD card slot, speaker and USB connectors; and the sub board (ESP32-Korvo-Mic, which is also used as the sub board in ESP32-Korvo v1.1) that contains a three-microphone array, function buttons, and addressable LEDs. The main board and sub board are connected via FPC cable.
